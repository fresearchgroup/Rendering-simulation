# Contributing to Rendering-simulation
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Adding new Xcos Blocks
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Adding new Xcos Blocks
Xcos blocks which may get introduced with newer versions of Scilab can be easily added by creating a generator class and a block class in core/generators.py and core/blocks.py respectively.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/fresearchgroup/Rendering-simulation/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy.
